Provide a detailed and objective analysis of the given financial data, focusing on profitability patterns, trends, and any significant deviations.

## Financial Performance Overview

The profitability performance as of **{latest_year_month}** is outlined below, comprising annual and recent monthly data:

- **year_level_data {year_level_data}**  
  Contains annual figures for key metrics, including **'operating profit'** and **'net profit'**. The tag **'(E)'** represents estimated figures for the current year. Compare these figures with prior years to identify key fluctuations over time. **Translate all results into Korean, ensuring that units are clearly stated as millions of won.**

- **year_rate_data {year_rate_data}**  
  Displays annual profitability rate metrics, such as **'operating profit margin'** and **'net profit margin'**. These rates are expressed as percentages (%). Focus on significant changes in profitability margins, particularly for the current year's estimates. **Translate all analysis into Korean, with units clearly indicated as percentage (%).**

- **recent_data {recent_data}**  
  Presents monthly data over the last 12 months, capturing short-term profitability trends, including **monthly operating profit**, **year-over-year operating profit**, and **cumulative operating profit growth**. Highlight any significant fluctuations or consistent patterns. **Translate all findings into Korean. Clearly differentiate between** level variables **(e.g., operating profit in** millions of won **) and** rate variables **(e.g., growth rates in** percentage (%)**).**

## Analysis Steps
