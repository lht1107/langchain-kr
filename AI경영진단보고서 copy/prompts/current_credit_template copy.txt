### Credit Grade Mapping Table:
The following table maps default probability ranges to credit grades:

| Grade | Default Probability (%) |
|-------|--------------------------|
| AAA   | 0.00–5.00               |
| AA    | 5.01–10.00              |
| A     | 10.01–15.00             |
| BBB   | 15.01–20.00             |
| BB    | 20.01–30.00             |
| B     | 30.01–40.00             |
| CCC   | 40.01–50.00             |
| CC    | 50.01–60.00             |
| C     | 60.01 이상               |

### Task Breakdown:
Your task is divided into two parts:

---

#### **1. Detailed Analysis (in English)**

Using the provided SHAP analysis results (`{analysis_results}`):  

**a) Current Credit Status**:  
- Determine the company's **default probability** and **credit grade** using the mapping table.  
- Explain the implication of the default probability for the company's financial stability.  

**b) Key Factors Analysis**:  
- Identify and explain the **top factors** influencing the default probability. Provide:  
   - **Feature Name**: Name of the factor.  
   - **Feature Value**: Current value of the factor.  
   - **Impact**: Impact on default probability (+/- %p).  
   - **Percentile**: Position within the industry (e.g., "Top 99%").  
   - **Explanation**: Describe the factor's role and its effect on financial stability in plain language.  

**c) Top 5 Increasing and Decreasing Factors**:  
- Analyze the **top 5 factors** that **increase** and **decrease** default probability. For each factor:  
   - Explain why the factor influences default probability.  
   - Provide any relevant relationships with other variables (if applicable).  

**d) Overall Summary of Credit Risk**:  
Summarize the key findings, highlighting:  
   - The **primary factors** driving the increase and decrease in default probability.  
   - Key patterns or insights identified from the analysis.  
   - Strategic recommendations for improving financial stability.

---

#### **2. Final Report (in Korean)**
Using the **Detailed Analysis** above, create a **well-structured report in Markdown format** as follows:

### **1. 현재 신용 상태 평가**  
- **부도 확률**: Describe the company’s current default probability and corresponding credit grade. Explain what this means for the company’s financial situation (e.g., high risk or low risk relative to industry benchmarks).  

---

### **2. 부도 확률을 증가시키는 상위 5가지 요인**  

| **순위** | **요인**                  | **현재 값** | **백분위**  | **영향도 (+%p)** |
|---------|--------------------------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1       | `Factor 1 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |
| 2       | `Factor 2 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |
| 3       | `Factor 3 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |
| 4       | `Factor 4 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |
| 5       | `Factor 5 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |

---
**요약 설명**:  
- For each factor, explain **why it increases the default probability** and provide insights into its role in the company’s financial status. For example:  
  - **당좌비율(보통예금/유동부채) (값: 0.07 | 백분위: 상위 1%)**:  
    - 부도 확률에 **+12.54%p** 영향을 미쳤습니다.  
    - 이 요인은 낮은 유동성 비율로 인해 **단기 부채를 충당하기 어려움**을 나타냅니다.  

---

### **3. 부도 확률을 감소시키는 상위 5가지 요인**  

| **순위** | **요인**                  | **현재 값** | **백분위**  | **영향도 (-%p)** |
|---------|--------------------------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1       | `Factor 1 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |
| 2       | `Factor 2 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |
| 3       | `Factor 3 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |
| 4       | `Factor 4 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |
| 5       | `Factor 5 Name`          | `Value`    | `Percentile` | `Impact`        |

---
**요약 설명**:  
- For each factor, explain **why it decreases the default probability** and highlight its positive financial implications. For example:  
  - **최근 3개월 퇴사율 (값: 100.0 | 백분위: 상위 99%)**:  
    - 부도 확률에 **-12.99%p** 영향을 주었습니다.  
    - 높은 직원 유지율은 **인적 자원의 안정성**을 나타냅니다.  

---

### **4. 종합 요약**  
- **신용 상태 요약**: Summarize the company’s credit grade, default probability, and overall financial risk level.  
- **핵심 요인 요약**:  
   - **부도 위험 증가 요인**: List the primary factors driving risk.  
   - **부도 위험 감소 요인**: Highlight the factors mitigating risk.  
- **전략적 제언**:  
   - **단기 개선 방안**: Provide specific, actionable short-term strategies (e.g., liquidity management, reducing employee turnover).  
   - **장기 전략**: Suggest long-term improvements (e.g., diversification, stable funding operations).
