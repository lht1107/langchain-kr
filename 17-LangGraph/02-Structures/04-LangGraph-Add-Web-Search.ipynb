      "“Democrats need to be mature, and they need to be honest. And they need to say, ‘Yes, there is misogyny, but it’s not just misogyny from white men,’” Scarborough opined in the clip shared by the Daily Wire’s Ryan Saavedra.\n",
      "“It’s misogyny from Hispanic men, it’s misogyny from black men — things we’ve all been talking about — who do not want a woman leading them,” the former GOP congressman from Florida insisted.\n",
      "Scarborough, 61, also claimed that there “might be race issues with Hispanics that don’t want a black woman as president of the United States.”\n",
      "Social media users were quick to accuse Scarborough of racism.\n",
      "Follow The Post’s live updates on the 2024 election for the latest reactions, news and more\n",
      "“So according to @JoeNBC the people of color did not follow the directions of their elite white overlords?” asked one X user. “I think this is the definition of racism.”\n",
      "A second asked: “How is it that wealthy Whites like @JoeNBC think they should decide for minorities what is or isn’t racist?”\n",
      "ABC’s “The View”\n",
      "“The View” co-host Sunny Hostin also played the blame game – but set her sights on voters that she described as “uneducated white women.”\n",
      "“I’m profoundly disturbed … we know now that [Trump] will have unfettered power,” lamented Hostin, who, like some of her fellow hosts, dressed in all black.\n",
      "Hostin said that Trump’s historic win makes her worry for her daughter who now has “less civil rights” than she does.\n",
      "“I think [Trump’s victory] had nothing to do with policy, I think this was a referendum on cultural resentment in this country,” she mused.\n",
      "“Black women tried to save this country again, last night … what we do not have is white women, who voted about 52% for Donald Trump — uneducated white women, is my understanding. You have Latino men actually voting more for him,” Hostin opined.\n",
      "“I don’t think white women like being called uneducated white women,” co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin fired back.\n",
      "CNN\n",
      "CNN anchor Jake Tapper’s floored reaction made waves when he learned that Harris had failed to outperform President Joe Biden’s 2020 results in a single state.\n",
      "Tapper asked CNN chief national correspondent John King to pull up a graphic showing in which states Harris had gotten at least 3% more votes than Biden had in the last election — just to be presented with a gray map reflecting her failure even in that.\n",
      "“Holy smokes!” Tapper gasped. “Literally nothing?”\n",
      "“Literally not one county?” Tapper asked again, still sounding shocked in the footage, which was viewed more than 5 million times in just one clip shared on X.\n",
      "Trump handily won the election after reversing his 2020 losses in the crucial states of Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n",
      "CNN political commentator Van Jones also appeared to be on the verge of crying as it became increasingly apparent that Trump would easily defeat Harris.\n",
      "Jones, the former Obama administration official and Democratic Party activist, gave a somber assessment of the election late Tuesday, saying he “woke up this morning with a dream” only to be “going to bed with a nightmare.”\n",
      "“I’m thinking about the people who are not a part of anybody’s elite, who are hurting tonight,” Jones told CNN co-panelists on Tuesday as the vote count in the key battleground states showed Trump well positioned to capture a second term in the White House.\n",
      "PBS\n",
      "Liberal PBS News commentator Jonathan Capehart was left similarly aghast at the preliminary election results.\n",
      "“There’s a shift right and then there’s a shift to Trump,” Capehart vented.\n",
      "“I am mystified in some ways simply because we’re talking about a twice-impeached, four-times-indicted, convicted-on-34-felony-counts former president.”\n",
      "Capehart further bemoaned that the election could be indicative of “who we are as a country” — adding that “from what I’m seeing right now, I’m not sure that I like it.”\n",
