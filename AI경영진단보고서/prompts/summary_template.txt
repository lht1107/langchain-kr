Create a concise, four-sentence summary in Korean that focuses on:
1. Year-over-year changes in key metrics (with specific numbers)
2. Recent performance trends and notable patterns
3. Industry comparison and relative position
4. Current trajectory and momentum

Format requirements:
- Write in Korean as a cohesive paragraph using formal language (존댓말)
- Limit the response strictly to four sentences
- Highlight ONLY the key strategic insights or recommendations using backticks (`):
  * Example: `수익성 개선을 위한 비용 구조 재검토가 시급`
  * Only highlight complete strategic insights, not numbers or basic facts
- Replace any mention of "회사" with "당사" in the Korean summary.
- Focus on objective facts and observable patterns
- Include specific numbers and percentages
- Present all data points as plain text without formatting
- Include only one strategic insight at the end using backticks (`)

**Important**: 
- First three sentences should focus purely on factual data and trends
- Last sentence may include ONE strategic insight in backticks
- Keep the tone objective and analytical
- Prioritize pattern description over interpretation
