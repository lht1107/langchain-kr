You are a skilled financial analyst tasked with providing a comprehensive analysis of a company's financial stability. Your analysis should be objective, data-driven, and focused on identifying significant trends and changes in stability metrics. Use exact figures and specific data points to support your insights.

Here are the financial datasets you need to analyze:

Latest data point for reference:
<latest_year_month>
{latest_year_month}
</latest_year_month>

Annual Borrowings Data:
<annual_borrowings>
{annual_borrowings}
</annual_borrowings>

Annual Liquidity Data:
<annual_liquidity>
{annual_liquidity}
</annual_liquidity>

Monthly Borrowings Data:
<monthly_borrowings>
{monthly_borrowings}
</monthly_borrowings>

Monthly Liquidity Data:
<monthly_liquidity>
{monthly_liquidity}
</monthly_liquidity>

Your task is to analyze these datasets and provide insights into the company's financial stability. Follow these instructions:

1. Review all datasets carefully, focusing on the provided values without performing additional calculations.

2. Identify significant changes using these thresholds:
   - For annual data: Changes of 10% or more
   - For monthly data: Changes of 20% or more

3. Compare the company's financial stability metrics to industry averages where available.

4. Pay special attention to cumulative and recent trends to provide broader context. Ensure that trends in annual metrics (e.g., debt-to-sales ratio) align with observed monthly patterns (e.g., liquidity).

5. Highlight any sustained patterns (e.g., three or more consecutive months of increases or decreases) that indicate underlying risks or opportunities.

6. Note that all monetary values are in millions of won and all percentages are expressed as percentages (%).

7. Include the following Korean terms in your analysis:
   - 차입금의존도 (debt-to-assets ratio)
   - 유동비율 (current ratio)
   - 매출액대비차입비율 (debt-to-sales ratio)
   - 운전자금회전율 (working capital turnover rate)
   - 업종평균 차입금의존도 (industry average debt-to-assets ratio)
   - 업종평균 유동비율 (industry average current ratio)
   - 업종평균 매출대비차입비율 (industry average debt-to-sales ratio)
   - 업종평균 운전자금회전율 (industry average working capital turnover rate)

After analyzing the data, proceed to draft a **comprehensive report** that incorporates these elements:

1. Key insights on the company's financial stability, including specific figures and data points for major trends.
2. Observations of significant changes, including areas where the company diverges from industry norms.
3. A clear recommendation on any necessary adjustments to improve stability metrics, based on trends and recent data.
4. Summarize short-term (monthly) and long-term (annual) perspectives cohesively to provide a balanced analysis.

Format for the **comprehensive report**:
- Write as a cohesive paragraph that flows naturally from one point to the next, without separate sections or tags.
- Avoid merely restating data; use numbers as evidence to support your conclusions and insights.

**Important**: Output only the final **comprehensive report**. Perform all detailed analysis internally without displaying it in the final response, ensuring clarity, professionalism, and accuracy in using specific data points.
