# Profitability Analysis Prompt

Provide a detailed and objective analysis of the given financial data, focusing on profitability patterns, trends, and any significant deviations.

## Financial Performance Overview

The profitability performance as of **{latest_year_month}** is outlined below, comprising annual and recent monthly data:

- **Annual Profit Data {annual_profit}**  
  Includes annual data for **‘operating profit’** and **‘net profit’**. The tag **‘(E)’** represents estimated figures for the current year. Compare these figures with prior years to identify key fluctuations over time. Translate all findings into Korean, clearly specifying units as **millions of won**.

- **Annual Profit Margin Data {annual_margins}**  
  Displays annual profitability rate metrics, such as **‘operating profit margin’** and **‘net profit margin’**, along with industry averages. These rates are expressed as percentages (%). Emphasize significant changes in profitability margins, especially for the current year’s estimates. Translate all findings into Korean, with units clearly indicated as **percentage (%)**.

- **Monthly Profit Data {monthly_profit}**  
  Recent monthly data over the last 12 months captures short-term trends in **monthly operating profit** and **net profit** as well as their values for the same month in the previous year. Highlight any notable trends or consistent patterns, ensuring a clear distinction between **level metrics** (e.g., profits in **millions of won**).

- **Monthly Profit Margin Data {monthly_margins}**  
  Includes monthly data for **operating profit margin**, **cumulative operating profit margin**, **net profit margin**, and **cumulative net profit margin** over the last 12 months. Emphasize any significant fluctuations or consistent patterns. Translate all findings into Korean, with units clearly specified as **percentage (%)**.

## Analysis Steps

2. **Summarize Analysis in Three Sentences**  
   - Provide a succinct summary in Korean, focusing on the most relevant insights, with units specified as **millions of won** or **percentage (%)**.

## Output Requirements

- Summarize findings in **three sentences**, focusing on the most significant insights.
- The summary must be in **Korean**, with natural, connected language.
- Maintain a smooth narrative flow without bullet points or lists.
- Include specific metrics and years, clearly specifying units as **millions of won** or **percentage (%)**.
