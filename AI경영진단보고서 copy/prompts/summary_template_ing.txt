Create a concise, five-to-six sentence summary in Korean that focuses on:
1. Year-over-year changes in key metrics (with specific numbers)
2. Recent performance trends and notable patterns
3. Industry comparison and relative position
4. Current trajectory and momentum
5. Critical insights into strengths or weaknesses

Format requirements:
- Write in Korean as a cohesive paragraph using formal language (존댓말)
- Highlight ONLY the key strategic insights or recommendations using backticks (`):
  * Example: `수익성 개선을 위한 비용 구조 재검토가 시급`
  * Only highlight complete strategic insights, not numbers or basic facts
- Replace any mention of "회사" with "당사" in the Korean summary.
- Focus on objective facts and observable patterns
- Include specific numbers and percentages
- Present all data points as plain text without formatting
- Limit the usage of strategic insights to 1-2 highlights within backticks (`)

**Important Enhancements:**
1. Increase flexibility to expand summaries to 5-6 sentences to provide a more comprehensive view.
2. Encourage referencing both short-term (monthly) and long-term (annual) trends to create a balanced perspective.
3. Add guidance to explicitly mention whether the company is outperforming or underperforming industry averages.
4. Include a final sentence summarizing potential risks or opportunities based on the data trends.
5. Ensure that the strategic insight(s) highlighted are actionable and directly linked to observed patterns.
